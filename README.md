Make sure you read these steps in order to use my program.

1) Make sure that 3.7 is installed with 'Add Python 3.7 to path' setting is enabled. You need to install a module called termcolor for it to work by using the command 'pip install termcolor'. You can also use it in a virtual environment. This is a console file, I will make a GUI version of this project soon.

2) For those of you who are unable to install termcolor, use main_no_termcolor.py file instead of main.py file or use the exe file that I have provided which exists in a zip folder. Unfortunately, the exe file gets unstable with settings, and often the settings don't work. The exe file should kept in the same folder with all the dependencies. Another thing to mention about the exe file, the exe file gets updated less often than the main.py file.

3) I am providing contact support for those of you who are unable to install soon.

Download exe file(located in zip folder): 
Please extract the zip folder to find the exe file: https://github.com/pranav387/AREA_CIRCUMFERENCE_CIRCLE_ADVANCED/blob/main/areaofcircle_exe_container.zip
