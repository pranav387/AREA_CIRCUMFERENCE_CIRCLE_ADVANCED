Make sure you follow these steps to learn how to use my program.

Make sure that 3.7 is installed with 'Add Python 3.7 to path' setting is enabled. You need to install a module called termcolor for it to work by using the command 'pip3.7 install termcolor'. You can also use it in a virtual environment. This is a console file, I will make a GUI version of this project soon.

For those of you who are unable to install termcolor, I have also provided an exe file of main.py which exists in a zip folder. But the exe file gets unstable with settings, and often the settings don't work. The exe file should kept in the same folder with all the dependencies. Another thing to mention about the exe file, the exe file gets updated less often than the main.py file.

I am providing contact support for those of you who are unable to install soon.

 Download exe file(located in zip folder): 
 Please extract the zip folder to find the exe file:
